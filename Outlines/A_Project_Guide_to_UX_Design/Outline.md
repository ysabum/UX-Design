For User Experience Designers in the Field or in the Making, Third Edition  
**Russ Unger and Carolyn Chandler**  

## [Introduction](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/pref04.xhtml#pref04lev1sec1:~:text=events%2C%20and%20more-,Introduction,-Why%20We%20Wrote)
### [Why This Book Was Written](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/pref04.xhtml#pref04lev1sec1:~:text=Our%20goal%20with,your%20own%20purposes.)

The goal with this book is to give the basic tools and context that will help the reader use UX tools and techniques with working teams. The authors' intent was to provide the core information and knowledge that the reader should have to perform many of the activities they will need as a UX professional. Unger and Chandler share their own experiences as well as advice and ideas from other experts to help the reader identify ways to jumpstart the basic materials and allow them to mash up the information and create something newer, better, or even more suited to their own purposes.

## [Chapter 1: The Tao of UXD](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch01.xhtml#ch01lev1sec1:~:text=1-,The%20Tao%20of%20UXD,-Curiosity%20Meets%20Passion)
### [What Is UX Design?](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch01.xhtml#ch01lev1sec1:~:text=User%20experience%20design%20is,user%20behavior%20and%20perception.)

User experience (UX) design can be defined as the creation and synchronization of the elements that affect users’ experience with an organization’s products and services, using data-informed insights on user behavior and perception.
- **Elements** include things a user can:
    - touch (such as tangible products and packaging)
    - hear (music and audio signatures)
    - smell (the aroma of freshly baked bread in a sandwich shop)
    - interact with in ways beyond the physical
        - digital interfaces (websites and mobile apps)
        - people (customer service representatives, salespeople, and friends and family)

This book focuses on the *design of digital experiences*—in particular, such interactive media as websites and apps.

## [Chapter 2: The Project Ecosystem](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch02.xhtml#ch02lev1sec1:~:text=2-,The%20Project%20Ecosystem,-Planning%20for%20Project)
### [Identify the Type of Product](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch02.xhtml#ch02lev1sec1:~:text=other%20project%20structures.-,Identify%20the%20Type%20of%20Product,-No%20black%2Dand)

Some relative differences in product focus and characteristics are identifiable. Your product will probably associate strongly with one of four types:

- **Brand presence:** the primary online destination for an organization when someone performs a general search.
    - It facilitates the relationship between the organization and a general audience (anyone interested in its products, services, initiatives, or job opportunities).

- **Promotional product:** a targeted page, microsite, or app meant to elicit a specific and measurable response from a particular audience or from a general audience over a limited period of time.

- **Content source:** a store of information, potentially composed of several types of media (articles, documents, video, photos, tutorials) meant to inform, engage, or entertain users.

- **Task-based application:** a tool or collection of tools meant to allow users to accomplish a set of key tasks or workflows.

### [Consider Different Devices](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch02.xhtml#ch02lev1sec2:~:text=may%20be%20involved.-,Consider%20Different%20Devices,-As%20you%20can)

Designing a digital experience for an interactive wall display is very different from designing one for an Apple Watch. Not only is there a difference in the size of the display, but there are often differences in how people interact with them. Some electronic devices don’t have a display at all and use voice for interactions (or require a companion app).

#### Thinking Mobile
- The usage of mobile devices is enormous.
- Starting with mobile design creates constraints that make you focus on the essential data and actions in your product.
- Some of the capabilities that mobile devices provide aren’t as consistently available or effective on desktops.

#### Responsive Design
Should adapt to multiple displays:
- **Flexible grids:** that expand or contract content based on screen resolution.
- **Flexible images:** that decrease in size on smaller screens or increase to a set maximum size on larger screens.
- **Media queries:** which are elements of code that can be placed in a site’s HTML and stylesheet. These queries gather information about a device’s display capabilities and use them to serve up different styles accordingly.

#### Web Apps vs. Native Apps
Native mobile apps, like those for iOS and Android devices, have:

- Currently, a better user experience than web apps (in general). 
- An easier method for monetizing the product (if that’s your goal).

Web apps bring:

- A greater degree of reach (theoretically).
- In most cases, a more cost-effective solution.

#### Hybrid and Cross-Platform Options

Hybrid apps use a native wrapper that has the app function much like a native app, but also incorporates web views that allow parts of the app to use browser-based components. This allows the team to use native components for things like navigation, while having the contents of a view use a web page that can be updated at any time (rather than having to go through the full app store submission process whenever a change needs to be made).

#### Interactions Across Devices

Although desktop web and mobile apps are among the most common products that UX designers work on, the expansion of digital devices in every area of life makes it important to have the mindset that a product is part of a network of connectivity.

### [Choose Your Hats](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch02.xhtml#ch02lev1sec3:~:text=a%20UX%20designer.-,Choose%20Your%20Hats,-When%20you%20become)

When you become the UX designer on a project, you often end up having to play several roles with related responsibilities.

- **Information Architect:** responsible for creating models for information structure and using them to design user-friendly navigation, search, and content categorization. 
    - Common responsibilities include creating site maps and ensuring that categories and subcategories of information are distinct and user-friendly.
- **Interaction Designer:** responsible for defining the behavior of a site or application in accordance with user actions, and for understanding how users are engaging with the product.
    - Common activities are to create storyboards or task flows showing interactions with the product, or to create wireframes or prototypes representing how a user might engage with it. 
- **UI Designer:** responsible for crafting and refining the visual elements of the site or application.
    - This effort includes designing a look and feel that creates an emotional connection with the user and is in line with the brand guidelines.
    - Also responsible for creating a clear, consistent, and engaging visual style for the digital product from a high level 
- **Product Designer:** responsible for interaction design decisions down to the UI level, as a UI designer is, but has additional responsibilities of growing and improving the product over time over the course of many releases.
    - Involved in experimentation around what a product should include, and ideation on new features or experiences can make an impact for users.
- **User Researcher:** responsible for providing insights regarding the needs of end users, based on information that is generated from, or validated with, the research that person conducts with users.

Some of the more common overlapping roles include:
- Brand strategist or steward
- Product manager
- UX strategist
- Service designer
- Business analyst
- Content strategist
- UX writer
- Front-end developer

## Reflection for Chapters 1-2

The overall tone of the book is welcoming to the reader and reflective. Rather than sounding more dry and impersonal like other textbooks, this book opens by appealing to empathy and positioning UX design as both a mindset and a practice. In that way, this book is similar to Don Norman’s "The Design of Everyday Things." Both books help readers think differently about experiences, where design decisions are grounded in human behavior and mental models.

The book could have stronger navigation for selective reading (e.g., more subheadings so the reader can move around the book and find what they need faster) to help improve the experience of using the book. 

## [Chapter 3: DesignOps, ResearchOps, ContentOps, Oh My!](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch03.xhtml#ch03lev1sec1:~:text=3-,DesignOps%2C%20ResearchOps%2C%20ContentOps%2C%20Oh%20My!,-All%20the%20Work)

### [What is the role of DesignOps on a design team?](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch03.xhtml#ch03lev1sec1:~:text=component%20of%20Operations.-,Design%20Operations,-Design%20Operations%20is)

Its primary purpose is to reduce the friction that occurs in doing design-related work. It also aims to enhance collaboration across projects and teams, to create opportunities to foster innovation, and to establish a culture of continuous learning and improvement.
- DesignOps brings together the people, processes, and tools to streamline the design process, creating a systematic approach to design that maximizes efficiency and minimizes roadblocks.
- DesignOps helps make the work of design more effective, scalable, and impactful in a business context by meeting the needs of designers in such a way that they can focus on actual design instead of spending their time on less design-y items.

### [Why is DesignOps important?](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch03.xhtml#ch03lev1sec1:~:text=The%20need%20for%20consistency%20and%20efficiency%20becomes%20more%20prevalent%20as%20design%20teams%20grow%2C%20and%20that%E2%80%99s%20where%20DesignOps%20comes%20into%20play.)

- The need for consistency and efficiency becomes more prevalent as design teams grow.
- With design teams more focused on the design aspects of the work, the DesignOps team helps ensure that project and product consistency are in place, which can help with overall brand recognition and customer satisfaction, while also allowing the work of design to happen quicker, resulting in faster times to market.
    - Combined, all of these things make a positive impact on the business.

### [How are research operations critical to good design?](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch03.xhtml#ch03lev1sec2:~:text=and%20their%20skills.-,Research%20Operations,-In%20a%20recent)

ResearchOps is the people, mechanisms, and strategies that set user research in motion. It provides the roles, tools, and processes needed to support researchers in delivering and scaling the impact of user research across an organization.

- ResearchOps becomes crucial in such scenarios, helping out teams by creating and managing the processes for performing research and all research-related activities.
    - This enables the various research teams to concentrate more on actual research and analysis of user data, which leads to more effective, efficient, and consistent research outcomes.

## [Chapter 4: Project Objectives and Approach](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch04.xhtml#ch04lev1sec1:~:text=4%20Project%20Objectives%20and%20Approach)
### [What are the four questions you should have answered by the end of a kickoff meeting?](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch04.xhtml#ch04lev1sec1:~:text=Why%20is%20the,from%20business%20stakeholders%3F)

- *Why is the project important to the company?*

- *How will stakeholders determine if the project was a success?*

- *What approach or methodology will the project follow?*

- *What are the major dates or milestones for key points, such as getting approval from business stakeholders?*

### [Waterfall Methodology](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch04.xhtml#ch04lev1sec2:~:text=across%20different%20methodologies.-,Waterfall%20Methodology,-A%20waterfall%20methodology)

![waterfall](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780138188283/files/graphics/f0403.jpg)

A waterfall methodology involves treating the steps of a project as separate, distinct phases, where approval of one phase is needed before the next phase begins. 
- The linear process then proceeds through implementation, testing, and maintenance.

### [Agile Methodologies](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch04.xhtml#ch04lev1sec2:~:text=and%20the%20schedule.-,Agile%20Methodologies,-Because%20change%20is)

![agile](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780138188283/files/graphics/f0404.jpg)

Agile methodologies follow a more fluid approach, with some steps happening alongside each other... AKA using an agile, or rapid development, approach. An agile approach generally has a greater focus on rapid collaboration and a reduced focus on detailed documentation and formal sign-off.

### [The Double Diamond](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch04.xhtml#ch04lev1sec2:~:text=are%20often%20referenced%3A-,The%20Double%20Diamond,-framework%2C%20created%20by)

![dd](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780138188283/files/graphics/04-06_double_diamond.jpg)

The Double Diamond framework models an approach to the discovery work on a project. Teams diverge as they explore the challenge, converge on a definition of the problem, diverge again as they explore ways to address that problem, and converge again on the solution to launch.

### [Lean UX](<https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch04.xhtml#ch04lev1sec2:~:text=that%20product%20well).-,Lean%20UX,-complements%20a%20lean>)

![lean](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780138188283/files/graphics/f0405.jpg)

Lean UX complements a lean product management approach. Lean practices focus on reducing waste in the project’s process by keeping documentation to a minimum and keeping a tight constraint on the number of features included in each iteration.
- For designers, the hallmarks of a lean UX approach are a higher use of sketches and conversations, and a move away from detailed and formalized deliverables.

### [Dual-track product development](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch04.xhtml#ch04lev1sec2:~:text=on%20customer%20response.-,Dual%2Dtrack%20product%20development,-is%20an%20agile)

![dualtrack](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780138188283/files/graphics/04-08_dualtrack_agile.jpg)

Dual-track product development is an agile variation that runs two different tracks of work concurrently. A lean Discovery track is meant to help the team explore user needs, while an agile Delivery track focuses on the delivery of product releases.

### [Design sprints](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/ch04.xhtml#ch04lev1sec2:~:text=not%20been%20validated.-,Design%20sprints,-were%20popularized%20by)

![designsprints](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9780138188283/files/graphics/04-09_designsprint.jpg)

Design sprints were popularized by Jake Knapp during his work with Google Ventures. They are a method of running some of the phases of the second diamond in the Double Diamond approach in a short, focused scope of work over the course of five days.
- A small multidisciplinary team immerses themselves in the week-long sprint, exploring and sketching ideas, choosing ones to prototype, and then testing that prototype with customers.

## Reflection for Chapters 3-4

**These chapters are really focused on organization and planning, why are these critical to doing design in industry?** In the industry, design involves stakeholders, timelines, budgets, technical constraints, etc. As such, organization and planning are critical because they create the conditions that allow good design to happen at the right scale.

**Which of the project planning and management methods appealed to you the most and why?** The method that appealed to me most was dual-track product development. With industry design work, project teams are expected to deliver on deadlines while also learning about users and validating ideas. By giving Discovery its own track, the teams have the space to explore and test without directly affecting the Delivery team. Compared to methods that assume everything can be known upfront, this method feels more realistic. 

**Between design ops, content ops, and research ops, which appealed to you most and why?** ResearchOps appealed to me the most because research is foundational to good design, but in practice it often becomes rushed and/or underutilized due to other logistical challenges, like coordinating and scheduling participants. However ResearchOps directly addresses this problem by creating systems that allow research to be conducted efficiently and at scale, and according to ethical guidelines.
