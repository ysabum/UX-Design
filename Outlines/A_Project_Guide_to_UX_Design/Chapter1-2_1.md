### [Why This Book Was Written](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-project-guide/9780138188283/pref04.xhtml#pref04lev1sec1:~:text=Our%20goal%20with,your%20own%20purposes.)

The goal with this book is to give the basic tools and context that will help the reader use UX tools and techniques with working teams. The authors' intent was to provide the core information and knowledge that the reader should have to perform many of the activities they will need as a UX professional. Unger and Chandler share their own experiences as well as advice and ideas from other experts to help the reader identify ways to jumpstart the basic materials and allow them to mash up the information and create something newer, better, or even more suited to their own purposes.
